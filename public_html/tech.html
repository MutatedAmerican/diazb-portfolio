        <p>*APP Academy</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The APP Academy is a new learning community that is only at PHS. This academy is basically showing students the ways of modern technology. It is also an academy where you can be helped in order to create your very own websites, games, and many more. What makes this academy unite is not only its amazing staff, or the amount of participation from the students, but what its reward, the knowledge gained from this program will help us in future technology and on creativity on the internet. Being part of APP was the happiest moment of my life and will help me in the future, and even present school times. I may not want to major on such class, but it will surely get me ahead of life.</p>

    <p>*Computer Science</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the day would soon come an and, I enter to my last class, which would be ,of course, Computer Science. Overall, this would be my favorite class out of all of my other classes. Not only we learn about websites and other cool stuff, and we are even called,"Cyber Warriors",but I can a good amount of friends in this class and see their creativity, and how cool our teacher and substiute teacher is. The teacher we have is named Mr.Lee, it`s his first time teaching a class in PHS, and he is even a future father. All I could say to his soon-to-be child is two things, I wish you a bright future with the help of your parents, and you are very lucky to have a mother very beautiful and Mr.Lee as your father. (Now, we have Moises...yeah.)</p>
