                        <p>*Introduction</p>                        
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Bryan Diaz. The age I am currently am in is 14 years old. I may look white, but don`t let my skin fool you, for you see, I am Hispanic. Personality for me, I believe that we live in a world where seeing is not believe, meaning not all we know is true. For my free time, I simply enjoying playing with my electronic I currently have. For some reason, I love to predict what will happen is the future, so I can be prepared, and it all showed because of my electronics.</p>

                        <p>*Family</p>                        
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I am the youngest brother, yet still older than my sister. My family is contained with my mother, father, 2 of my older brothers, and 1 younger sister. It was a hard choice choosing my parents because I loved them both. But if I had to pick, I would say that my father and my oldest brother, Edgar, would be my favorite because they just know me so well.  The most interesting sibling is Anthony because you really don`t know what he will do next.</p>

                        <p>*Extra-Curricular Activities</p>                        
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my extra-curricular activities, whenever I have my own time, I really don`t do much. What I basically do is just play on my electronics. What I mean is going on the computer, or laptop, and just fooling around, going to website to website, watching videos on YouTube, and playing games on it. Another activity I do is going on my phone and just goof around on it. I also do play myself some XBOX 360 online and watch Netflix on the Wii. Finally, when I feel bored, I exercise.</p>
