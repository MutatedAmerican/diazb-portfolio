                        <p>Introduction</p>
                        
                            <p>My name is Bryan Diaz. The age I am currently am in is 14 years old. I may look white, but don`t let my skin fool you, for you see, I am Hispanic. Personality for me, I believe that we live in a world where seeing is not believe, meaning not all we know is true. For my free time, I simply enjoying playing with my electronic I currently have. For some reason, I love to predict what will happen is the future, so I can be prepared, and it all showed because of my electronics.</p>

                        <p>Family</p>
                        
                        <p>It seems that I am the youngest brother, yet still older than my sister. My family is contained with my mother, father, 2 of my older brothers, and 1 younger sister. It was a hard choice choosing my parents because I loved them both. But if I had to pick, I would say that my father and my oldest brother, Edgar, would be my favorite because they just know me so well.  The most interesting sibling is Anthony because you really don`t know what he will do next. Since we currently don`t have any pets, I do not have any feelings to my pets, although, I wish I had a pet golden retriever.</p>

                        <p>APP Academy</p>
                        
                        <p>The APP Academy is a new learning community that is only at PHS. This academy is basically showing students the ways of modern technology. It is also an academy where you can be helped in order to create your very own websites, games, and many more. What makes this academy unite is not only its amazing staff, or the amount of participation from the students, but what its reward, the knowledge gained from this program will help us in future technology and on creativity on the internet. Being part of APP was the happiest moment of my life and will help me in the future, and even present school times.</p>

                        <p>Extra-Curricular Activities</p>
                        
                        <p>As for my extra-curricular activities, whenever I have my own time, I really don`t do much. What I basically do is just play on my electronics. What I mean is going on the computer, or laptop, and just fooling around, going to website to website, watching videos on YouTube, and playing games on it. Another activity I do is going on my phone and just goof around on it. I also do play myself some XBOX 360 online and watch Netflix on the Wii. Finally, when I feel bored, I exercise. Yeah, that`s right, but not for my amusement, because of the future. I want to prepare myself as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>Future</p>
                        
                        <p>There are only 2 futures that lie ahead of me, either way, I am prepared for both.  The first future is that everything will be all right in the future. I can succeed in my career on being either an engineer, a doctor, or working at a gamingâ€™s company. In that future, I won`t live in a mansion, but I will live in my dream house I always wanted. As for my family and friends, my friends and I will still be connected and hang if timing is available, but overall, I will love to spend time with my family. And the second future is the end. Overall, whether it`s one or another, I will be prepared for any situation.</p>
